# Hi there, I'm Anas 👋
Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a **Web Developer** based in France, with a passion for crafting clean, functional, and fun web experiences. I spend most of my time exploring the web with **Svelte, React, TypeScript,** and **Node** but I’m always curious and love learning new tools and technologies.

## 🔧 What I’m currently working on:
- Building sleek web interfaces with **SvelteKit** and **Tailwind**
- Creating APIs using **GraphQL** and **Hasura**
- Improving my **CI/CD** skills and automating all the things 🚀

## 🌱 What I’m learning next:
- Getting deeper into **TDD** and best testing practices with **Playwright** 🧪
- Exploring **serverless architectures** and edge computing
- Maybe picking up some Rust? Who knows! 🤔

## 🎸 Fun facts about me:
- When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me jamming on my **bass guitar** or reading manga. 🎶📚
- Huge fan of all things **comics** and **BD**—ask me for recommendations!
- I love sharing knowledge and geeking out over the latest in tech with fellow devs. Let's connect and chat about your favorite framework or library!

## 🛠️ Technologies I love working with:
- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Svelte, React, Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, GraphQL
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Tools:** Docker, Git, Notion, and a dash of **Excalidraw** for sketching ideas ✏️
